## Hi, I'm Simon Teuwens and welcome to my Github page!

I studied Applied Linguistics and, more recently, finished my degree in Computer Science.
My hobbies are quite varied, I enjoy playing basketball, drums, guitar as well as gaming and playing chess.
More recently, Machine Learning and AI have become subjects that I've gotten increasingly interested in.

On this profile you'll find projects that I coded during my studies, either as part of assignments or during my free time.
The first few years of my studies were more focused on C and Java, but as I took up classes involving Machine Learning and Deep Learning I started predominantly working with Python.
I also forked some popular Deep Learning repositories to use for research, though these usually only entailed minor changes.
Most assignments were either too small or too messy to upload, so I've decided to only upload some more recent and relevant projects.
The largest project so far has been a chess engine that I tried to develop from scratch in C++ while trying to avoid simply copying code.
It's not a very powerful engine, but it was a lot of fun trying different approaches!
